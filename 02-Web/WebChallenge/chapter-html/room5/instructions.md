# Room 5: Add Images with Alt Text

## Problem
The gallery has placeholders where images should be. Each needs a proper `<img>` tag with both `src` and `alt` attributes.

## Task
Edit `index.html` to add an `<img>` tag inside each `.gallery-item` div with:
1. A `src` attribute pointing to the placeholder URL provided in comments
2. An `alt` attribute with descriptive text for accessibility

## Success Condition
- All 3 gallery items must contain an `<img>` element
- Each `<img>` must have both `src` and `alt` attributes
- The `alt` attribute must not be empty

## What You Can Edit
- `index.html` only

## Hint
Example: `<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/200x150/1a3a5c/00d9ff?text=Key" alt="A golden key">`

## Common Mistakes
- Forgetting the alt attribute entirely
- Using empty alt="" (only valid for decorative images)
- Not closing the img tag (it's self-closing, no </img> needed)
- Forgetting quotes around attribute values
