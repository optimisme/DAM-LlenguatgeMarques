# Room 2: Use Relative Units

## Problem
The container has a fixed width of 400px, which doesn't adapt to different screen sizes.

## Task
Edit `styles.css` to change the `.container` width from `400px` to a relative unit like `100%` or `90%`.

## Success Condition
The `.container` must fill at least 85% of its parent's width.

## What You Can Edit
- `styles.css` only

## Hint
Change `width: 400px;` to `width: 100%;`

## Common Mistakes
- Using a percentage that's too small (like 50%)
- Forgetting the % sign
- Removing the width property entirely
- Using `vw` units without understanding viewport width
