# Room 3: Style the Form

## Problem
The form inputs have no internal padding, making text hard to read and the form look cramped.

## Task
Edit `styles.css` to add proper padding to both the input and textarea elements.

## Success Condition
Both `.styled-form input` and `.styled-form textarea` must have at least 10px of padding.

## What You Can Edit
- `styles.css` only

## Hint
Change `padding: 0;` to `padding: 12px;` for both input and textarea rules.

## Common Mistakes
- Only styling the input and forgetting the textarea
- Using margin instead of padding (margin is outside, padding is inside)
- Forgetting the unit (px, rem, em)
- Adding padding to the form instead of the inputs
