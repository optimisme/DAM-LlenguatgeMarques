# Room 4: Stack the Blocks

## Problem
The blocks are displayed in a horizontal row, but they should be stacked vertically.

## Task
Edit `styles.css` to change the `flex-direction` from `row` to `column`.

## Success Condition
The `.container` must have `flex-direction: column` (or `column-reverse`).

## What You Can Edit
- `styles.css` only

## Hint
Change `flex-direction: row;` to `flex-direction: column;`

## Common Mistakes
- Removing `display: flex` (it's still needed!)
- Using `direction` instead of `flex-direction`
- Misspelling `column` as `coloumn`
- Adding a new property instead of changing the existing one
