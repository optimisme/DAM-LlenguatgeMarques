# Room 1: Activate Flexbox

## Problem
The three numbered items are stacking vertically (default block behavior). We want them side by side in a row.

## Task
Edit `styles.css` to add `display: flex;` to the `.container` class.

## Success Condition
The `.container` element must have `display: flex` applied.

## What You Can Edit
- `styles.css` only

## Hint
Add `display: flex;` inside the `.container` rule block.

## Common Mistakes
- Adding `display: flex` to the items instead of the container
- Misspelling `flex` as `flexbox`
- Forgetting the semicolon
- Adding the property outside the rule block
