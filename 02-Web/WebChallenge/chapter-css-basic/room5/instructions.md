# Room 5: Style the Ancient Scroll

## Problem
The scroll's text has poor typography - the title is too small, the text is gray and hard to read, and the code isn't emphasized.

## Task
Edit `styles.css` to fix three typography issues:
1. `.scroll-title`: increase `font-size` to at least 24px
2. `.scroll-text`: change `color` to something other than gray
3. `.scroll-code`: add `font-weight: bold` (or 700)

## Success Condition
- Title font-size must be >= 24px
- Text color must not be gray
- Code must be bold (font-weight >= 700)

## What You Can Edit
- `styles.css` only

## Hint
- For title: `font-size: 28px;`
- For text: `color: #4a3520;` (brown) or `color: #2c1810;` (dark brown)
- For code: `font-weight: bold;` or `font-weight: 700;`

## Common Mistakes
- Using font-size without units
- Forgetting that `bold` is equivalent to `700`
- Setting color with wrong syntax (forgetting #)
- Changing the wrong selector
