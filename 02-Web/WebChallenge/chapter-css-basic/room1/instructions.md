# Room 1: Reveal the Hidden Message

## Problem
There's a secret message hidden in the box, but the text color matches the background color (both white), making it invisible.

## Task
Edit `styles.css` to change the `.secret-box` background color to something darker so the white text becomes visible.

## Success Condition
The `.secret-box` must have a background color that is dark enough to make the white text readable.

## What You Can Edit
- `styles.css` only

## Hint
Look for the `.secret-box` rule and change `background-color: #ffffff;` to a darker color like `#000000` or `#1a1a2e`.

## Common Mistakes
- Changing the text color instead of the background
- Using a color that's still too light to read white text
- Misspelling `background-color` (e.g., `backgroud-color`)
- Forgetting the semicolon at the end
