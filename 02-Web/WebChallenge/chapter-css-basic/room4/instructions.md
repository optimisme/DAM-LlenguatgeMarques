# Room 4: Style the Door Frame

## Problem
The door is missing its frame (border). Without a frame, the door looks incomplete.

## Task
Edit `styles.css` to add a visible border to the `.door-frame` element.

## Success Condition
The `.door-frame` must have a border with:
- Width of at least 3px
- A visible style (solid, dashed, double, etc. - NOT none)

## What You Can Edit
- `styles.css` only

## Hint
Change `border: none;` to `border: 5px solid #8B4513;` or any other visible border.

## Common Mistakes
- Using `border-width` without `border-style` (style defaults to none)
- Forgetting one part of the border shorthand
- Setting border-color same as background (invisible border)
- Using `outline` instead of `border`
